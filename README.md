A 2D game engine written in Python using PyGame to interface SDL.

My first attempt at a multi-layered, parallax, smooth scrolling enabled 2D
engine. It might be used for LD22 but it might not. LD22 (and b1naryth1ef,
thanks man!) definitely inspired me to get off my ass and try writing it
either way.
