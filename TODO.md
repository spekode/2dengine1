Doable:
[ ] Collision detection for entities and tiles

[ ] Sounds

[ ] Level editor (very simple one)

[ ] Define constants and stop using hardcoded values

[ ] Write a bouncing-ball entity so player has someone to play with

Maybe:
[ ] Switch from colorkey to alpha images (alpha might be [faster][blitcomparison])
